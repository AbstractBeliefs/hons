    \section{Title of Project}
        GPU Accelerated Calculation of Radio Viewsheds

    \section{Project Content and Milestones}
        This project intends to research the validity and effectiveness of GPU acceleration of radio viewshed
        calculations. The project aims to take common algorithms that are used to complete these calculations and
        convert them from purely CPU to GPU-accelerated versions. These resulting algorithms can then be compared with
        their CPU counterparts and their relative performance examined. Following this, the converted algorithms will
        be packaged in a reusable manner for others to benefit from.
    \section{Deliverables}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CPU and GPU viewshed calculation tools used to generate results and performance data
            \item Documentation listing the findings of comparing the resultant data.
            \item A report into the validity of the project work, and possible application of the findings to other
                    areas
        \end{itemize}
    \section{Target Audience for the Deliverables}
        The target audience for the deliverables will mainly exist in two areas: firstly, those who need to generate
        viewsheds, who presently need to either purchase proprietary tools to do so in a fast or automated manner, and
        secondly those who are interested in GPU accelerated GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications, as the
        field has a large number of parallelisable problems, many of which are at present unaccelerated.
    \section{The Work to be Undertaken}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Initial investigation into the current state of the art for accelerated GIS and ray casting
            \item Investigation of
